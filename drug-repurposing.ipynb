    "An unwelcome cyclone may have cancelled my hiking plans, but it gave me the opportunity to delve into the fascinating world of drug repurposing. This blog post explores how identifying new uses for existing drugs can dramatically accelerate and reduce the cost of bringing vital treatments to patients, and how recent advances in machine learning can further streamline this process.\n",

    "Over the Easter long weekend, Auckland was visited by Cyclone Tam, which meant my hiking trip was cancelled. At least it gave me some time to work on a few projects and finish this blog post I'd been meaning to do for a while!\n",

    "## Drug Repurposing\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditional drug discovery is a marathon, often taking over a decade and requiring an investment of more than a billion dollars for each successful drug. This lengthy and costly process highlights the urgent need for more efficient strategies to combat disease. One such promising strategy is drug repurposing: identifying new therapeutic uses for existing drugs or those already undergoing clinical trials. By bypassing much of the early-stage development, and sometimes significant parts of clinical trials, drug repurposing offers the potential to significantly reduce both the time and financial cost associated with bringing new treatments to patients. Drug repurposing is ideal for addressing therapeutic needs in disease areas where financial incentives are limited (such as neglected tropical diseases and antibiotic development), or for rapid deployment in situations demanding swift treatment interventions for imminent public health emergencies, such as during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n",
    "\n",
    "One well-known example of drug repurposing is sildenafil, originally developed to treat high blood pressure and angina (chest pain), and famously repurposed for erectile dysfunction after clinical trials revealed this unexpected side effect. Another is thalidomide, developed to treat morning sickness and found to cause birth defects, which is now used to treat cancers and skin disorders associated with leprosy. The crucial role of drug repurposing was further highlighted during the recent COVID-19 pandemic, where the corticosteroid dexamethasone emerged as a vital intervention in reducing mortality among severely ill patients.\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine learning offers a novel method for drug repurposing. Using high-quality activity data for a target of interest, a machine learning model can be trained to predict active compounds based on their molecular structure. This trained model can then be used to screen libraries of compounds for potential repurposing.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Drug Repurposing Hub\n",
    "\n",
    "The [Drug Repurposing Hub](https://www.nature.com/articles/nm.4306.epdf) is a curated and annotated collection of drugs that have already received FDA approval or are currently undergoing clinical trials. Maintained by the Broad Institute, this resource serves as both a virtual library, providing comprehensive information on each compound, and a physical library, offering access to compound plates for experimental screening.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Antibiotic Discovery using Deep Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "This post was inspired by the work of the [Collins Lab at MIT](https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(20)30102-1), who used deep learning techniques to identify potential compounds for repurposing as treatments for antimicrobial-resistant bacteria. Their research addresses the escalating crisis of antibiotic resistance, a looming threat projected to cause 10 million deaths annually by 2050.\n",
    "\n",
    "To tackle this challenge, the researchers assembled a primary training set of 2,335 molecules, experimentally screening them against *E. coli* BW25113 and identifying 120 compounds with antimicrobial activity. With the goal of creating a robust and generalizable model, they ensured the training set was structurally diverse. This data was then used to train a directed message-passing neural network (dMPNN) to create a classification model capable of predicting antimicrobial activity based on a molecule's chemical structure. The trained model was subsequently used to make predictions on virtual libraries of compounds, including the Drug Repurposing Hub.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ninety-nine molecules from the Drug Repurposing Hub that were predicted to be active were experimentally tested, with 51 displaying growth inhibition against *E. coli*. This process led to the identification of a particularly promising compound, the c-Jun N-terminal kinase inhibitor SU3327, which the researchers named halicin. Notably, halicin possesses a structure distinctly different from conventional antibiotics and demonstrated potent inhibitory activity against *E. coli* growth.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Chemprop\n",
    "\n",
    "Central to this research is the open-source software package [Chemprop](https://chemprop.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). Developed primarily by researchers at MIT using the PyTorch framework, Chemprop harnesses the capabilities of message-passing neural networks (MPNNs) for molecular property prediction. Chemprop can be used both as a command-line interface (CLI) and a Python API. It implements a d-MPNN architecture, a type of graph neural network particularly effective for extracting relationships from molecular structures represented as graphs. An advantage of Chemprop is its ability to learn directly from molecular representations, such as SMILES strings converted into molecular graphs, eliminating the need for manual feature engineering, which can also introduce biases.\n",
    "\n",
    "## ChEMBL\n",
    "\n",
    "Lacking access to a physical lab for experimental data, I needed an alternative approach for data gathering. For this, I used ChEMBL, a freely accessible and meticulously curated chemical database housing bioactivity data for drug-like molecules. It is maintained by the European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI), part of the European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL) in the UK. Using the [ChEMBL Webservice](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4489243/), I was able to specifically download data relevant to the target of interest. This retrieved data then served as the foundational dataset for training a machine learning model, which was subsequently employed to virtually screen the compounds within The Drug Repurposing Hub.\n",

    "## Getting the Data from ChEMBL\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the ChEMBL Webservice, I downloaded the data associated with a target for training a machine learning model using the three functions below. The first searches ChEMBL with a target name, and returns the target ChEMBL ID of the most similar target. The second downloads the activity data associated that the target ChEMBL ID, along with the molecular ChEMBL IDs. The third returns the canonical SMILES for the molecular ChEMBL IDs. I was finding the ChEMBL Webservice can be quite slow, and occasionally gets stuck retrieving a record, so I've added a timeout decorator so if a request takes more than ten seconds it just moves onto the next one."
